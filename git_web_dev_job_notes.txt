Section 1:
  Lecture 1 - Course Overview

Section 2:
  Lecture 2 - What is Git?

  Lecture 3 - Intro to Git

  Lecture 4 - Git your hands dirty
    git --version
    git config --global user.name "Eric Chuderewicz"
    git config --global user.email "echuderewicz@gmail.com"
    creating a brand new reposity: git init
    git add <name_of_file>
    git commit -m "my first commit"
    to restore your files if something happens type below:
    git checkout -- .
    to clone from Git repo: navigate to the directory you would like to clone to on your computer:
    git clone https://github.com/LearnWebCode/welcome-to-git.git

  Lecture 5 - Setup your github
    create a new travel-site repo on Github server
    on local machine, clone the starter files:
    git clone https://github.com/LearnWebCode/travel-site-files.github
    rename directory to "travel-site"
    git remote -v (this tells you what Git thinks is the remote site)
    to change the remote site:
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/echuderewicz/travel-site.git
    now confirm:
    git remote -v (you have just updated the location of your remote server)

Section 3:
  Lecture 6 - Node.js & NPM
    automation and organization explained

  Lecture 7 - A quick note

  Lecture 8 - Node.js introduction
    3 main parts:
      What is Node.js
      Help install
      Example:
        node experiment: create a file and retrieve an image from the internet

  Lecture 9 - NPM - Node Package Manager
    npm install jquery (we did this first but then deleted it).
    A better way is to create a grocery list:
    npm init (this creates the package.json file)
    npm install jquery --save (this updates the package.json file)
    npm install normalize.css --save
    to regenerate if you deleted jquery and normalize use command below
    npm install
  Lecture 10 - important note about version numbers
    copied over the populated package.json file since many packages of much later versions
    than the udemy video (a good way to avoid the pain of things not working)

Section 4:
  Lecture 11 - gulp
    installing gulp globally
      sudo npm install gulp-cli --global
    adding gulp within project
    npm install gulp --save-dev
    touch gulpfile.js
    need gulp plugins to do anything useful
    npm install gulp-watch --save-dev
    gulp watch (will start up the watch commmand. See gulp file)
    ctrl-c to stop gulp watch

  Lecture 12 - Gulp and PostCss
    what is a css workflow - variables, nesting etc.
    important gulp and node terms
    Autoprefixer
    PostCss = fastest to compile, new kid on the block
    gulp.src, gulp.dest, pipe used in gulpfile.js
    install PostCss:
      npm install gulp-postcss --save-dev
      npm install autoprefixer --save-dev
      npm install postcss-simple-vars --save-dev
      npm install postcss-nested --save-dev
      all the above are then required into the gulpfile.js

Section 5:
  Lecture 13 - CSS File Architecture
    file architecture - organize css code into smaller files
    identify patterns
    rules and guidlines to follow
    npm install postcss-import --save-dev
    started using css imports, created a css modules and base subfolder within the styles folder
    positioned the large hero block vertically and horizontally over the banner image

  Lecture 14 - What is the BEM methodology
    B. - block
    E. - element - belongs to a block
    M. - modifier - a change to the default state of an object

    *CSS selectors should target elements directly with classes, instead of relying on type selectors, descendent selectors, and the cascade.

    *Because we are limiting cascade we are free to move blocks around and reuse them throughout the page. Blocks are independant and self contained.

    *identify patterns, and the create single responsibility blocks

    *makes the relationship between our HTML and CSS Clear

    in the following classname .large-hero__title, the underscore prefix indicates that the following is an SUBELEMENT of the LARGER .large-hero block.

    to create nesting. use the ampersand "&". For instance, right the above as "&__title" while nesting. This will then get transformed by postcss as .large-hero__title.

  Lecture 15 -
    discussion on rem.
    font-size, padding, or margin should be declared using
    rem. based on html element --> 1.5rem x 16px (default html) = 24px. Using px as a unit sets things in stone which isn't good.

    styled buttons and was first exposed to using the -- nomenclature. for instance btn--orange, btn--large. This is how you specify MODIFIERS.

Section 6

  Lecture 16 - Gulp Timeout - leveraging browsersync
    npm install browser-sync --save-dev
  Lecture 17 - Organizing our gulpfile.js
    created a gulp folder and then cut code from main gulpfile and placed it into a tasks/styles.js and task/watch.js files
  Lecture 18 - Updated gulp so that it errors gracefully and logs a
    message to the console without stopping

Section 7

  Lecture 19 - What does Mobile First Mean
    from a Design Context: designing around a smaller screen first, forces us to prioritize our content, anticipate most common user actions, information architects, graphic designers, usability experts

    from a Development Context: Coding the site so devices don't download unnecessary data, treat the most essential view of our website as our baseline and code upwards from there. Make the site load quickly for everyone

    best practices for mobile first:
      design for the smallest device (smart phone) and consider this the default. All devices sizes beyond use media queries @media

    mixins discussed in middle of video
      npm install postcss-mixins --save-dev
      mixins were created in their own seperate file in the styles/base directory.
      each mixin atSmall, atMedium, and atLarge contained a media query
      this query was then essentially used as a trigger within certain class
      elements within the _large-hero.css file. It almost acts like an "if" statement. if the media is "such and such", then modify "this" particular element accordingly. So everything is "triggered" by the size of the screen. This lesson is important to keep coming back to because it shows exactly how everything gets "wired" up. It's a bit complicated. 


  Lecture 20 - Responsive Images
    There are 2 reasons to use responsive images:
      1. Art direction - different cropping
      2. File Size to optimize download
    Different ways to handle this. For the art direction reason you must
    use the <picture> tag. 


  Lecture 21 - Tips for responsive images
    Author created images with the widths explicitely shown within the image itself. Being able to test all images especially the hi dpi versions
    Google Chrome has a way to test pixel densities. Check 'responsive image option and change DPR to 2 (DPR stands for device pixel ratio'

    I came up with a way in sublime to swap images with "i" suffix version. This handles the tedium of having to go to each individual filename and append the "-i".

Section 8 - Let's Build
  Lecture 22 - Creating Reusable Blocks
    created a wrapper class to add spacing left and right for the mobile view header text. created a dark blue line under banner - browser treat elements as in-line by default, in other words, it treats them like text, provide space below but making it block level will removed this behavior. It treats it more like a div where it's more like a square that aligns perfectly. 

    also adjusted the mixins for the font sizes for the default: atTiny and atSmall. Note, there isn't atTiny, it's just that we refer to the default as that (mobile first) and that everything else above at beyond gets called out. 

    Lots of progress was made in this section and to note: I had skipped adding part of the code from Lecture 19 which dealt with media queries so this commit will be a bit of a hodge podge.

  Lecture 23 - Headline Block
    styled the headline block for both large and small screen. Lots of back and forth. Essentially the workflow is to look at both form factors and decide what present styles are not working in the mobile form. You should go over this video multiple times to allow this to sink. There is potential for confusion to occur regarding this material. 

  Lecture 24 - Reusable Column layout
    started creating a 2 column layout. Author showed how to clear a float. The sloppy way first...
