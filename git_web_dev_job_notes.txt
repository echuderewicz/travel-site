Section 1:
  Lecture 1 - Course Overview

Section 2:
  Lecture 2 - What is Git?

  Lecture 3 - Intro to Git

  Lecture 4 - Git your hands dirty
    git --version
    git config --global user.name "Eric Chuderewicz"
    git config --global user.email "echuderewicz@gmail.com"
    creating a brand new reposity: git init
    git add <name_of_file>
    git commit -m "my first commit"
    to restore your files if something happens type below:
    git checkout -- .
    to clone from Git repo: navigate to the directory you would like to clone to on your computer:
    git clone https://github.com/LearnWebCode/welcome-to-git.git

  Lecture 5 - Setup your github
    create a new travel-site repo on Github server
    on local machine, clone the starter files:
    git clone https://github.com/LearnWebCode/travel-site-files.github
    rename directory to "travel-site"
    git remote -v (this tells you what Git thinks is the remote site)
    to change the remote site:
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/echuderewicz/travel-site.git
    now confirm:
    git remote -v (you have just updated the location of your remote server)

Section 3:
  Lecture 6 - Node.js & NPM
    automation and organization explained

  Lecture 7 - A quick note

  Lecture 8 - Node.js introduction
    3 main parts:
      What is Node.js
      Help install
      Example:
        node experiment: create a file and retrieve an image from the internet

  Lecture 9 - NPM - Node Package Manager
    npm install jquery (we did this first but then deleted it).
    A better way is to create a grocery list:
    npm init (this creates the package.json file)
    npm install jquery --save (this updates the package.json file)
    npm install normalize.css --save
    to regenerate if you deleted jquery and normalize use command below
    npm install
  Lecture 10 - important note about version numbers
    copied over the populated package.json file since many packages of much later versions
    than the udemy video (a good way to avoid the pain of things not working)

Section 4:
  Lecture 11 - gulp
    installing gulp globally
      sudo npm install gulp-cli --global
    adding gulp within project
    npm install gulp --save-dev
    touch gulpfile.js
    need gulp plugins to do anything useful
    npm install gulp-watch --save-dev
    gulp watch (will start up the watch commmand. See gulp file)
    ctrl-c to stop gulp watch

  Lecture 12 - Gulp and PostCss
    what is a css workflow - variables, nesting etc.
    important gulp and node terms
    Autoprefixer
    PostCss = fastest to compile, new kid on the block
    gulp.src, gulp.dest, pipe used in gulpfile.js
    install PostCss:
      npm install gulp-postcss --save-dev
      npm install autoprefixer --save-dev
      npm install postcss-simple-vars --save-dev
      npm install postcss-nested --save-dev
      all the above are then required into the gulpfile.js

Section 5:
  Lecture 13 - CSS File Architecture
    file architecture - organize css code into smaller files
    identify patterns
    rules and guidlines to follow
    npm install postcss-import --save-dev
    started using css imports, created a css modules and base subfolder within the styles folder
    positioned the large hero block vertically and horizontally over the banner image

  Lecture 14 - What is the BEM methodology
    B. - block
    E. - element - belongs to a block
    M. - modifier - a change to the default state of an object

    *CSS selectors should target elements directly with classes, instead of relying on type selectors, descendent selectors, and the cascade.

    *Because we are limiting cascade we are free to move blocks around and reuse them throughout the page. Blocks are independant and self contained.

    *identify patterns, and the create single responsibility blocks

    *makes the relationship between our HTML and CSS Clear

    in the following classname .large-hero__title, the underscore prefix indicates that the following is an SUBELEMENT of the LARGER .large-hero block.

    to create nesting. use the ampersand "&". For instance, right the above as "&__title" while nesting. This will then get transformed by postcss as .large-hero__title.

  Lecture 15 -
    discussion on rem.
    font-size, padding, or margin should be declared using
    rem. based on html element --> 1.5rem x 16px (default html) = 24px. Using px as a unit sets things in stone which isn't good.

    styled buttons and was first exposed to using the -- nomenclature. for instance btn--orange, btn--large. This is how you specify MODIFIERS.

Section 6

  Lecture 16 - Gulp Timeout - leveraging browsersync
    npm install browser-sync --save-dev
  Lecture 17 - Organizing our gulpfile.js
    created a gulp folder and then cut code from main gulpfile and placed it into a tasks/styles.js and task/watch.js files
  Lecture 18 - Updated gulp so that it errors gracefully and logs a
    message to the console without stopping

Section 7

  Lecture 19 - What does Mobile First Mean
    from a Design Context: designing around a smaller screen first, forces us to prioritize our content, anticipate most common user actions, information architects, graphic designers, usability experts

    from a Development Context: Coding the site so devices don't download unnecessary data, treat the most essential view of our website as our baseline and code upwards from there. Make the site load quickly for everyone

    best practices for mobile first:
      design for the smallest device (smart phone) and consider this the default. All devices sizes beyond use media queries @media

    mixins discussed in middle of video
      npm install postcss-mixins --save-dev
      mixins were created in their own seperate file in the styles/base directory.
      each mixin atSmall, atMedium, and atLarge contained a media query
      this query was then essentially used as a trigger within certain class
      elements within the _large-hero.css file. It almost acts like an "if" statement. if the media is "such and such", then modify "this" particular element accordingly. So everything is "triggered" by the size of the screen. This lesson is important to keep coming back to because it shows exactly how everything gets "wired" up. It's a bit complicated. 


  Lecture 20 - Responsive Images
    There are 2 reasons to use responsive images:
      1. Art direction - different cropping
      2. File Size to optimize download
    Different ways to handle this. For the art direction reason you must
    use the <picture> tag. 


  Lecture 21 - Tips for responsive images
    Author created images with the widths explicitely shown within the image itself. Being able to test all images especially the hi dpi versions
    Google Chrome has a way to test pixel densities. Check 'responsive image option and change DPR to 2 (DPR stands for device pixel ratio'

    I came up with a way in sublime to swap images with "i" suffix version. This handles the tedium of having to go to each individual filename and append the "-i".

Section 8 - Let's Build
  Lecture 22 - Creating Reusable Blocks
    created a wrapper class to add spacing left and right for the mobile view header text. created a dark blue line under banner - browser treat elements as in-line by default, in other words, it treats them like text, provide space below but making it block level will removed this behavior. It treats it more like a div where it's more like a square that aligns perfectly. 

    also adjusted the mixins for the font sizes for the default: atTiny and atSmall. Note, there isn't atTiny, it's just that we refer to the default as that (mobile first) and that everything else above at beyond gets called out. 

    Lots of progress was made in this section and to note: I had skipped adding part of the code from Lecture 19 which dealt with media queries so this commit will be a bit of a hodge podge.

  Lecture 23 - Headline Block
    styled the headline block for both large and small screen. Lots of back and forth. Essentially the workflow is to look at both form factors and decide what present styles are not working in the mobile form. You should go over this video multiple times to allow this to sink. There is potential for confusion to occur regarding this material. 

  Lecture 24 - Reusable Column layout
    started creating a 2 column layout. Author showed how to clear a float. The sloppy way first and then the right way. Author also did some convoluted gutter manipulation. Just seemed so "hacky" -- used overflow:hidden to make this work, occurred around 15 minutes into the lesson. Here is a list of what he did: 

      1. created (2) column layout
      2. added right gutter to both columns
      3. used border box so avoid exceeding max width
      4. added -65px margin to parent row
      5. this then extended beyond max width
      6. used overflow hidden to remove the -65px
      7. my only guess was that it was to preserver the 4/8 column row split
    
  Lecture 25 - Attention to Detail - part 1 - making images responsive in "our beginning" section
    added some bottom margin to 'our beginning section' using a media query mixin on the wrapper class. Adjusted for smaller screens as well.

    Focused mainly of making on making the "first-trip" and "our-start" images responsive, this was very
    complicated but we tested the same way we did with banner, use the "-i" versions to see which image
    the browser serves up. 

    Pretty much all the code that was added was in the index.html file....


  Lecture 26 - Attention to Detail - part 2 - styling the text in the "our beginning" section
    more tedium

Section 9
  Lecture 27 - GIT Branches
    this section went through how to checkout branches. It's pretty straightforward
    make sure working directory is clean before creating a new branch
    git branch <name>
    git branch (lists branches)
    git checkout <name>
    git checkout master (switching back to master branch)
    now within master you can merge the branch you were working on
    git merge <name> (this adds the branch history as well) 

    Here is a way to add and commit in one command:
    git commit -am "message"

    Deleting a branch
    git branch -d <name>

    Moving on: 
    author also showed a way to merge from github, It looked a little complicated
    and I'll problably not use it as much.

    here is a way to name a branch and check it out in one command
    git checkout -b <name>

Section 10 - Our Features Section
  Lecture 28
    see above for how to name and checkout a new branch in one command
    Styled the our features section but didn't complete it (still had to finish the mobile view). Leveraged some of what was created before
    to create styling, namely 2 column layout. This section was much less tedious than the previous section. 
  Lecture 29: continuation of styling the Our Features Section
    Finished styling our features section
    discussed the following git command
    git merge our-features --no-ff (stands for no fast forward) - this didn't
    quite work the way the video depicted it. I might want to test this out again.
    it appears to be a way to consolidate all the commits that occurred while you
    were in the branch. So in other words, the commit history isn't carried over. It
    compressed.

  Section 11 - Building Testimonial Section

    Lecture 30:
      git checkout -b testimonials
      fairly straightforward regarding styling the left most testimonial

    Lecture 31: 
      continued to style testimonials and made it look good for small screens.
      This one had a bit of styling content that was leveraging previous material and I was getting lost

    Lecture 32:
      additional testimonial styling and configuring the content to adjust at a slightly 
      different breakpoint. Instead of testimonials stacking once screen get to medium the 
      author wanted have the stacking occur when the testimonials met the atLarge breakpoint.
      This was due to the testimonials get "scrunched" together. 

      We then merged the testimonials branch into master and then pushed this up to github.

  Section 12: Gulp Timeout (Automated Sprites)

    Lecture 33: sprite file generation
      created a new sprites.js file to run a new gulp task
      below is how we installed the npm package

      npm install gulp-svg-sprite --save-dev

      svg sprite package has documentation on github

    Lecture 34: 
      npm install gulp-rename --save-dev
      lots of small tweaks to sprite automation

    Lecture 35:
      npm install del --save-dev

  Section 13: Finish Styling the site

    Lecture 36: Styling the Footer
      checked out a new site-footer branch
      review use of span - I'm not sure why the author 
      is using this

      as a side note, I made some commit message mistakes
      and successfully went back and fixed them with the 
      following commands:

      git commit --amend (for previous commits)
      git rebase -i HEAD~3 (note that 3 represents the previous 3 commits, you'll open up in a text editor which will allow
      you to configure a line from "pick" to "reword", it will then send
      you into another vim to update the commit message. See 
      instructions here: 
      https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/

      also re: using VIM - hit 'i' for interactive (editing)
      once done hit escape

      also getting git to open sublime instead of vim
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD2O9EF58kI

      export GIT_EDITOR="subl --wait --new-window"
      to make this above permenent I placed into .profile within
      home directory. Every time the terminal opens it will read
      the variable as result of .profile directory existing within
      my $PATH

      I then added that directory to my $PATH variable
      PATH=$PATH:~/.profile

      obviously from above you have to have "subl" configured

      getting subl to work: follow the link below

      https://olivierlacan.com/posts/launch-sublime-text-3-from-the-command-line/

      sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
      
    Lecture 37: Styling the Header
      npm install postcss-hexrgba --save-dev
      This command above allows you to write variables
      within the rgba command, like so:
      background-color: rgba($mainBlue, .3) instead of 
      background-color: rgba(47, 85, 114, .3);
      Completed styling the header for large screens

    Lecture 38:
      Completed styling the header for small screens

  Section 14: Javascript Organization

    Lecture 39:
      Quick lesson on objects. No updates were made to the travel-site

    Lecture 40: The JS module Pattern and 'webpack'

      It should be noted that I had a lot of issues due to the current webpack version
      not being compatible with the lecture. The problems occurred with running this
      command
      npm install webpack -g (you can't run this )
      it's got to be:
      sudo npm install -g webpack@3.8.1 (this is in the package.json file)
      The notes below are a record of my troubles:

              installing webpack
              npm install webpack -g (globally)

              to run webpack just type the following into terminal:
              webpack (din't quite work because webpack and it's cli version are 
              two seperate files);

              I got this message so I said yes:
              Would you like to install webpack-cli? (That will run npm install -D webpack-cli) (yes/NO)yes. This didn't work

              So then I installed webpack as follows
              sudo nmp install webpack --save-dev
              then
              sudo npm install -D webpack-cli --save-dev

              npm WARN webpack-cli@2.0.14 requires a peer of webpack@^4.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
                npm WARN ajv-keywords@3.1.0 requires a peer of ajv@^6.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
                npm WARN travel-site@1.0.0 No description
                npm WARN travel-site@1.0.0 No repository field.
                npm WARN travel-site@1.0.0 No license field.

        In addition to sort out things out and checkout master I learned stashing
        I've included some commands here:

        git stashing:
          git stash
          git stash list
          git stash pop

        had issues installing jquery
        I removed the package-lock.json file as explained below:
        https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17340

    Lecture 41: Automating our webpack setup
      configured it so that 'webpack command can be called automagically'
      browser automagically reloads after saved .js file

    Lecture 42: Babel
      install babel:
        npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev

  Section 15: Writing Javascript for our header menu

    Lecture 43: How to avoid jQuery spaghetti code
      We were able to wire up the mobile menu with jquery
      This was my favorite lecture thus far!

    Lecture 44: Adjusting our mobile menu. There were a lot of
      of css tips and tricks that I didn't quite follow. Come
      back to this.
      
    Lecture 45: Animating the hamburger menu

    ***had difficulty getting the header branch to merge
    properly, stack overflow had a solution that worked perfectly
